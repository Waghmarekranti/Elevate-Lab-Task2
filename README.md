“This dashboard gives a complete story of our sales performance using different charts.

⿡ First, looking at the KPI cards, we can see our overall business numbers.
We achieved 85M total revenue, 53M total cost, and 32M total profit.
These cards help us quickly understand that the company is running profitably.

⿢ Next, the Pie Chart for Profit by Month shows which months performed the best.
From this chart, December, January, and May have the highest profit, which means these months bring strong sales.
Months like April show lower profit, telling us that we may need more offers or promotions during those months.

⿣ The Bar Chart for Profit by State shows where our business performs the best geographically.
States like California, New York, and Texas give the highest profit.
Some states have lower bars, meaning they are weaker markets and need improvement.

⿤ The Column Chart for Profit by Product Category helps us understand which products earn the most.
Chairs and Tables are the most profitable categories, while Storage and Bookcases show lower profit.
This tells us which products to focus on and which ones need better planning.

⿥ The Clustered Column Chart for Cost, Revenue, and Profit by Month shows the trend of our financial performance.
We can easily compare which months have high revenue and whether the cost is under control.
It also helps us spot months where profit is lower than expected.

⿦ Finally, the Pie Chart for Revenue by Country shows the contribution of each country.
The United States has the biggest share, followed by Germany and France.
Countries with smaller slices need better market strategies.
